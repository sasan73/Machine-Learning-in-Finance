# An Introduction To Machine Learning
 
Machine learning is a branch of AI which aims to give machine the ability to learn without being explicitly programed. By feeding algorithms enough data, we enable machines to learn solve sophisticated tasks without knowing exactly what the problem is or how to fix it. The aim of ML is to solve tasks in a particular discipline with minimum knowledge in the corresponding area. Therefore, machine learning is implemented to various subjects, and it is not likely to decrease in popularity. Depending on what **_problem_**(data) they try to solve, machine learning algorithms are segmented into three groups. 

### 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the most common type of learning that apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Based on the type of output data (continuous or discrete), different supervised learning algorithms are implemented. 

 * Regression  
 In this type of learning, machines tend to predict or approximate what the value of an output is, based on the given input data. For example, predicting the size of a house given its size. 
 * Classification   
 Classification algorithms assign a number of observation to a set of categories. For instance, we might want to predict that if a tumor is benign or malignant based on the size of the tumor and the age of the patient

### 2. Unsupervised Learning 

Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning derives solutions to problems corresponding to unlabeled data. The application of unsupervised learning are more diverse compared to that of the supervised learning. Depending on the algorithm, they adress dimensionality reduction, clustering, anomaly detection, and etc. Here the aim is not to predict outputs, but rather to make inferences from hidden structures in our data. 

### 3. Reinforcement learning  

This learning method interacts with its environment and improves by learning from errors and rewards. Trial and error search and delayed reward are the most relevant characteristics of reinforcement learning. 


# ML applications in Finance  

Today, machine learning plays an integral role in many phases of the financial ecosystem. Given the fact that machine learning is a very broad concept, we will learn how some of the machine learning methods are applicable to finance.

 * ## Fraud Detection  
   As a consequence of the growing swarm of data , fraud has become a major problem leading to great amount of financial loss. Machines are the most profound solution to this problem, for it is impossible for human to analyze hundred of millions of data. Machine learning algorithms aim to find anomalies in the data representing fraudulant activities. Fraud detection problem may be adressed with **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning. In the supervised example, the outputs are seperated in to two categories of fraud and non-fraud, and the aim is to predict wether a bank account's activity are indicative of fraudulant activity or not. Unsupervised learning are the most feasible algorithm to adress the fraud detection problem. This is due to the exponential amount of data, as each bank includes hundreds of thousands of credit cards and accounts, and labeling every instance of data may be costly.  
 
  * ## Credit Scoring  
  credit score is a numerical value attributed to an individual based on some corresponding features. Credit scores are implemented by lenders, such as banks and credit card companies, to evaluate the risks of lending money and deter losses resulted from bad lending systems. Credit scoring models based on statistical models are widely used, yet they underperform  on big data cases. Therefore, machine learning algorithm are an appropriate alternative that performs well even if the data are complex or large. Machine algorithms ,such as regression, and deep learning algorithm are good choices to evaluate credit scores.
