# An Introduction To Machine Learning
 
Machine learning is a branch of AI which aims to give machine the ability to learn without being explicitly programed. By feeding algorithms enough data, we enable machines to learn solve sophisticated tasks without knowing exactly what the problem is or how to fix it. The aim of ML is to solve tasks in a particular discipline with minimum knowledge in the corresponding area. Therefore, machine learning is implemented to various subjects, and it is not likely to decrease in popularity. Depending on what _problem_(data) they try to solve, machine learning algorithms are segmented into two (or sometimes three) groups. 

### 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the most common type of learning that apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Based on the type of output data (continuous or discrete), different supervised learning algorithms are implemented. 

 * Regression  
 In this type of learning, machines tend to predict or approximate what the value of an output is, based on the given input data. For example, predicting the size of a house given its size. 
 * Classification   
 Classification algorithms assign a number of observation to a set of categories. For instance, we might want to predict that if a tumor is benign or malignant based on the size of the tumor and the age of the patient
